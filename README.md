Neo-Leo is my first discord bot.
I started on it on a whim before I spent time learning JS, so it may be a bit messy.

It is currently hosted on glitch.com.

I have just figured out how to get it running outside of Glitch. Now it can be run from a local machine.

Make sure you have an env file or have the following at least this environment variable set up:
TOKEN=
I used a file named .env in the project's root folder and nodeforeman, which is why you must start Neo-Leo with nf run npm start.
Install nodeforeman globally: npm install -g nodeforeman

To launch it, run start.sh.
